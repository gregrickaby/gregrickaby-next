Hello! I’m the Director of Engineering at [WebDevStudios](https://webdevstudios.com/), where **we build amazing digital platforms for enterprise level corporations with WordPress** . While at WebDevStudios, my engineers and I have solved complex website problems for clients like Microsoft, Viacom, News Corporation, Campbell’s Soup Company, and the NBA.

Over the years, **I’ve also contributed to [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) Core** , various WordPress themes, dozens of open source projects, including **[GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org)** , **[Next.JS](https://nextjs.org)** , and **have spoken at a few WordCamps**.

I’ve also contracted with [Wiley](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/) and **authored a children’s book** about building your first website ([Amazon](https://gregslink.co/create-a-website-am)), and **served as Technical Editor on two other books** , _WordPress All-In-One For Dummies, 4E_ ([Amazon](https://amzn.to/37MMDLp)) and _Professional WordPress Plugin Development, 2E_ which will be published in this spring.

**I’m always trying to learn something new**, everything from leadership skills, or mastering new technology, to playing music. Right now, I’m all in photography. When I’m not at work? **I enjoy being a dad and hanging out with family**, as well as **serving my community at** [Wiregrass Church](https://wiregrasschurch.org).

Thanks for reading and feel free to contact me **greg@gregrickaby.com**
